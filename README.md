# UrsusBoot

**Compact OpenWrt-aware recovery and installation U-Boot for Airoha router platforms.**

UrsusBoot grew out of the OpenWrt U-Boot bootloader ecosystem and targets Airoha devices where a small persistent recovery environment is especially valuable. It combines WebFailsafe, OpenWrt image awareness, UBI migration and recovery primitives while staying small enough for constrained boot areas.

## Why UrsusBoot

The main advantage is simple: **it provides much of the functionality normally associated with a much larger recovery environment while fitting into an approximately 512 KiB boot-area contract.** No Linux kernel or userspace is required just to validate, migrate and install OpenWrt images.

Typical capabilities include:

- WebFailsafe recovery UI;
- OpenWrt `sysupgrade` / FIT awareness;
- stock / stock-layout / canonical UBI detection;
- UBI creation and migration;
- FIP and bootloader update paths;
- readback verification and fail-closed validation;
- recovery over network and Airoha BootROM/UART paths.

## What UrsusBoot actually is

UrsusBoot is **not a rewrite and not a custom bootloader**. It is the ordinary U-Boot that OpenWrt builds for Airoha — upstream U-Boot 2026.07 with the OpenWrt and Airoha platform patches — configured down to what a router actually needs, with a recovery layer added on top. Anyone who knows U-Boot will recognize everything inside it.

**Nothing Airoha-relevant was removed.** The build keeps 65 stock U-Boot commands, including the whole `mtd`/`ubi` stack, the full environment set, networking (`ping`, `tftpboot`, `wget`, `dhcp`, `dns`, `sntp`, `mii`, `mdio`), booting (`bootm`, `booti`, `bootflow`, `bootd`, `go`, `elf`), partitions (`part`, `gpt`), hashing and CRC, LZMA/LZ4/gzip decompression, and `gpio`/`pinmux`/`led`/`button`/`smc`. On top of those sit seven UrsusBoot commands, so the running bootloader offers 72 commands in total and a completely unlocked console.

**What was turned off is what a NAND router never reaches for.** 95 command groups and their subsystems are disabled: every filesystem (ext4, FAT, btrfs, squashfs, erofs, UBIFS, exFAT, cramfs, ZFS), every storage bus the board does not have (USB, MMC/SD, SATA, SCSI, NVMe, PCI, IDE, parallel SPI flash, OneNAND), the EFI loader, video, the bootmenu/bootstd/bootmeth machinery, TPM, i2c, ADC, DFU, fuse, pstore and a long tail of demos and benchmarks. Signature verification (`FIT_SIGNATURE`/RSA) is also off — FIT **hashes** are verified, FIT signatures are not.

That is the whole trick behind the size: no functionality was reinvented to fit the ~512 KiB boot-area contract, it was simply not compiled in.

What UrsusBoot genuinely adds on top of stock U-Boot:

- a **WebFailsafe web UI with a real U-Boot console in the browser** — the console tab runs the actual command line, not a curated subset;
- an **OpenWrt-aware image pipeline** — staging, classification and fail-closed validation of sysupgrade/FIT images before anything is written;
- **UBI creation, update and migration** with readback verification and typed refusal reasons;
- a **boot dispatcher** that picks a boot path from what is really on NAND and falls back to recovery instead of to a dead prompt;
- **FIP/bootloader self-update** and Airoha BootROM/UART recovery paths.

## Repository policy: self-contained

This repository is intended to be **self-contained**. A normal build must not clone or download code, templates or binary donors from any other projects.

The only external target build dependency permitted by policy is an **official OpenWrt SDK/toolchain** appropriate for the target AArch64 target. The host also needs a C compiler and liblzma development headers for the proven BL33 LZMA1EXT/no-EOPM packer. Board templates, boot-area templates, FIP lineage inputs, patches, configuration and build scripts belong in this repository.

The Nokia XG-040G-MD and XG-040G-MF board templates included here are 512 KiB stock boot-area templates. Device identity is not sourced from these templates; model-specific identity such as MAC/serial/GPON data belongs to the RI/BOSA/device-identity path and must be handled separately.

## No donor dump required

For supported boards the build/install flow does not require a user to dump `mtd0` first.

```text
board stock template + UrsusBoot FIP
                 |
                 v
      ready 512 KiB install mtd0
```

Example:

```bash
OPENWRT_SDK=/path/to/openwrt-sdk ./build.sh xg040-md persistent
```

This emits `u-boot.bin`, `u-boot.lzma`, a newly repacked `ursusboot-update.fip`, and `ursusboot-install-mtd0.bin` under `dist/xg040-md/`. The reference FIP supplies the proven platform lineage; its BL33 is replaced with the U-Boot produced by the same build and verified byte-for-byte before the install image is emitted.

For a completely bricked unit the same board template can be used by the Airoha BootROM/UART recovery flow. For a running Nokia stock firmware, a host installer can write the board-correct image through the rooted stock environment and verify readback. Device MAC/identity can be restored or configured separately from the sticker/device identity source when required.

## Host-side scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `build.sh` | Build U-Boot for a board and, when a FIP is available, emit a ready `mtd0` install image. |
| `src/u-boot/repack_persistent_fip.py` | Preserve the proven reference FIP lineage while replacing its BL33 payload with the U-Boot produced by the current build. |
| `src/u-boot/lzma1ext_noeopm.c` | Proven host-side LZMA1EXT/no-EOPM packer for the Airoha BL33 contract. |
| `scripts/make-install-mtd0.py` | Merge the board 512 KiB boot-area template with the newly repacked FIP into a flashable `mtd0` image. |
| `scripts/qa.sh` | Offline QA: byte-checks the board templates and the reference FIP, validates `board-profiles.json`, compiles the Python helpers, asserts the source tree is complete and self-contained. Run by CI. |
| `scripts/resolve_board_profile.py` | Read one field of one profile out of `config/board-profiles.json`. |
| `scripts/apply_kconfig_fragment.py` | Apply a `.cfg` Kconfig fragment onto a `.config`. |
| `scripts/apply_board_policy.py` | Apply a board policy header/anchors to the source tree. |
| `scripts/apply_runtime_role.py` | Switch the default environment between the `persistent` and `ram-recovery` runtime roles. |

Building:

```bash
OPENWRT_SDK=/path/to/openwrt-sdk ./build.sh xg040-md
URSUS_FIP=reference/md/ursusboot-test61-update.fip \
  OPENWRT_SDK=/path/to/openwrt-sdk ./build.sh xg040-md
```

```bash
OPENWRT_SDK=/path/to/openwrt-sdk ./build.sh xg040-md ram-recovery
```

`OPENWRT_SDK` (or the third positional argument) may point at an extracted OpenWrt SDK or standalone OpenWrt AArch64 toolchain; the cross compiler is located inside it automatically. Outputs land in `dist/<board>/`.

Boards, configs, templates and roles all come from `config/board-profiles.json` — `build.sh` hardcodes nothing and refuses unknown boards, unknown roles and roles a board does not allow. A board that is described but not yet buildable (no `config` declared) fails with an explicit message rather than a confusing build error.

The runtime role is applied **at source level** before the build: `ram-recovery` rewrites `bootcmd` in the default environment inside the tree, so it needs a clean checkout and cannot be applied twice in a row. Restore with:

```bash
git checkout -- src/u-boot/defenvs src/u-boot/include
```

### Runtime roles

| Role | `bootcmd` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `persistent` | `ursusdispatch` | Normal persistent supervisor boot from flash. |
| `ram-recovery` | `ursusweb;true` | RAM-only WebFailsafe recovery: go straight to the web UI and never touch the boot path. |

## Installing or updating UrsusBoot

The **recommended way to flash a freshly built `ursusboot-update.fip` is UrsusFlasher**. It is the operator-side installer/orchestrator for Windows and Linux and already knows the safe transports and verification sequence.

For supported hardware it can use whichever path is available:

- **UrsusBoot WebFailsafe** — upload the freshly built FIP through the bootloader web interface and let the normal update path validate, write and read back the bootloader;
- **stock Nokia Linux/root access** — transfer the image through the stock system, verify it, select the appropriate MTD writer and verify a full readback before reboot;
- **UART / Airoha Brick Mode** — use the serial recovery path when the web interface or stock Linux is unavailable, including BootROM/XMODEM recovery on a bricked unit.

For a custom locally built port, UrsusFlasher can also be used as the transport/orchestrator even before that board becomes a first-class built-in profile. In other words: **build the FIP here; let UrsusFlasher do the tedious and dangerous part whenever possible.**

The manual procedures below are the fallback/expert paths.

### Route A — stock Linux over root shell

All preconditions must hold before a write:

```sh
cat /proc/mtd
# mtd0 must be the bootloader partition: size 00080000, erase 00020000

cat /sys/class/mtd/mtd0/bad_blocks
# must report 0

command -v dd sha256sum
```

Back up the whole 512 KiB boot area and move that backup off the router:

```sh
dd if=/dev/mtd0 bs=131072 count=4 of=/tmp/mtd0-backup.bin
sha256sum /tmp/mtd0-backup.bin
```

A backup that exists only in `/tmp` is not a backup. Copy it to the PC and verify the same SHA256 there.

After transferring `ursusboot-install-mtd0.bin` back to the router, verify its SHA256 before writing. Use **one** writer only; do not try another writer after the first one has started because erase may already have happened:

```sh
mtd write /tmp/ursusboot-mtd0.bin bootloader

# or
flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 0 && nandwrite -p /dev/mtd0 /tmp/ursusboot-mtd0.bin

# or
flash_eraseall /dev/mtd0 && nandwrite -p /dev/mtd0 /tmp/ursusboot-mtd0.bin

# or
mtd_debug erase /dev/mtd0 0 0x80000 && \
mtd_debug write /dev/mtd0 0 0x80000 /tmp/ursusboot-mtd0.bin

sync
```

Before rebooting, read the entire boot block back and compare it with the image SHA256:

```sh
dd if=/dev/mtd0 bs=131072 count=4 2>/dev/null | sha256sum
```

If readback differs, **do not power-cycle**. Keep the running system alive and fix the write while recovery is still possible.

On OpenWrt, the boot MTD may be marked read-only. UrsusFlasher has dedicated support for that case, including its pinned `mtd-rw` path and the narrow `ursus-mtd-raw` writer.

### Route B — UART / XMODEM

Use a **3.3 V** UART adapter on TX/RX/GND, `115200 8N1`, no flow control.

If a U-Boot prompt is reachable:

```text
mtd list
loadx 0x8e000000
# send ursusboot-install-mtd0.bin with XMODEM

mtd erase bl2 0x0 0x80000
mtd write bl2 0x8e000000 0x0 0x80000
```

The partition name is layout-dependent. On factory layouts it is typically `bl2`; on canonical UrsusBoot/OpenWrt UBI layouts it may be `ursus-ubi-bl2`. **`mtd list` is authoritative; do not guess.**

For a unit with no prompt, Airoha BootROM recovery is two-stage:

1. Power off.
2. Hold Reset before applying power.
3. Send the proven preloader/BL2 over XMODEM.
4. Send the RAM-installer FIP over XMODEM.
5. Continue from the RAM-resident U-Boot without having touched NAND yet.

The currently hardware-proven MD BootROM stage-2 payload is the pinned alpha3 RAM-installer FIP used by UrsusFlasher. The `ram-recovery` role in this repository changes BL33 runtime policy to `bootcmd=ursusweb;true`, but **that alone is not yet a hardware proof that an arbitrary freshly repacked FIP is BootROM-stage-2 compatible**. Until that container/entry contract is validated on hardware, use UrsusFlasher's proven RAM-installer for brick recovery.

Once UrsusBoot is running, a freshly built persistent FIP can then be installed through WebFailsafe/UrsusFlasher with normal validation and readback.

## Built-in commands

UrsusBoot adds seven U-Boot commands. All of them are ordinary console commands and can be composed from the environment or typed by hand over UART.

| Command | Arguments | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ursusdispatch` | — | The boot policy. Samples the Reset button at boot; if held past the debounce window it latches recovery and enters WebFailsafe. Otherwise it picks a boot path from what is actually on NAND: UBI present → `ursusubiboot`; stock factory kernel present → direct `mtd read` + `bootm`; otherwise → `ursusstockboot`. **Every path that returns falls back to WebFailsafe rather than to a dead prompt.** |
| `ursusweb` | — | Runs WebFailsafe: brings up Ethernet and lwIP, serves the UI and HTTP API on `192.168.1.1:80`, and polls a live UART shell in the same loop. Re-entry is a no-op (`URSUS_WEB_ALREADY_RUNNING`). |
| `ursusubiboot` | — | Boot OpenWrt from the UBI `fit` volume. |
| `ursusstockboot` | `[master\|slave]` | StockBridge boot with Nokia `tcboot` board-argument parity. |
| `ursusupdate` | `check\|write <addr> <len>` | Validate, and optionally write, an UrsusBoot FIP staged in RAM. |
| `ursussettings` | `reset` | Erase and recreate only `rootfs_data` on an OpenWrt UBI or factory layout. Firmware and bootloader are untouched. |
| `ursuslanled` | `status\|enable` | Nokia LAN2-LAN4 hardware PHY LED routing. |

### Environment scripts

`defenvs/<soc>_<board>_env` holds the default environment. The useful entry points:

| Variable | Role |
|---|---|
| `bootcmd` | `ursusdispatch` — the dispatcher above. |
| `boot_tftp`, `boot_tftp_forever` | Netboot a recovery image, optionally in a retry loop. |
| `boot_tftp_write_fip`, `boot_tftp_write_bl2` | Fetch and write the bootloader over TFTP. |
| `ubi_write_production`, `ubi_read_production` | Write/read the OpenWrt `fit` volume. |
| `ubi_write_fip`, `ubi_create_env`, `ubi_format` | UBI volume management for the boot area. |
| `ethaddr_factory` | Derive the factory MAC from the `ri` volume. |
| `reset_factory` | Zero both `ubootenv` volumes back to defaults. |

> `ping` and `tftpboot` are shared-netif aware. While WebFailsafe owns Ethernet they borrow its live lwIP netif instead of tearing it down. Other network commands fail closed while that netif is active. From UART, `Ctrl-C` stops WebFailsafe; run `ursusweb` to start it again.

## Web UI

WebFailsafe serves one self-contained page from flash — no external assets, no CDN, RU/EN switchable. Layout:

```text
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| UrsusBoot   <bear>                              [RU] [EN]  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| tile: model/SoC | tile: layout | tile: flash | tile: state |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Install OpenWrt                 | UrsusBoot status        |
|   [ drop / pick firmware file ] |   version, build        |
|   [x] keep settings             |   layout, FIP, FIT      |
|   [Check firmware]              |   NAND geometry         |
|   [Install OpenWrt]/[Update]    |   UBI PEB/LEB counters  |
|   [OpenWrt UBI migration]       |   bad blocks            |
|   [Reset OpenWrt settings]      |   network state         |
|   validation result + reasons   |   [Reboot into OpenWrt] |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Tabs: Validation log | U-Boot console | Initramfs/FIT |    |
|       Update UrsusBoot                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Diagnostics (operation log, progress, stage, transaction)  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

The left column is the main firmware channel, the right column is read-only state plus the reboot control, and the tab strip holds the expert tools. Status is polled from `GET /api/status`; the log from `GET /api/log` and `GET /api/operation-log`.

### What each button does

Every button that can write requires an explicit confirmation header, and **no write happens inside the HTTP handler**: the endpoint validates, arms a pending operation, answers, and the NAND work then runs in the `ursusweb` main loop where progress is reported. Reboot is always manual.

| Button | Endpoint | Confirmation | Preconditions | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Check firmware** | `POST /api/firmware-begin` + `…/firmware-chunk` | — | — | Stages the file into RAM and classifies it. Read-only. |
| **Remove file** | `POST /api/discard` | — | — | Drops the staged image and its metadata. |
| **Install OpenWrt** | `POST /api/install-openwrt-stock-layout` | `INSTALL-OPENWRT-STOCK-LAYOUT` | Validated non-UBI sysupgrade; layout `STOCK` or `OPENWRT_STOCK_LAYOUT` | Arms the stock-layout install. |
| **Update OpenWrt** | `POST /api/install-ubi` | `INSTALL-UBI` + `X-Ursus-Keep-Settings: 1\|0` | Validated UBI sysupgrade; layout `OPENWRT_UBI`; no other operation active | Starts the UBI update. Answers `reboot: MANUAL`. |
| **OpenWrt UBI migration** | `POST /api/install-ubi` | `INSTALL-UBI` + `X-Ursus-Keep-Settings: 0` | Validated UBI sysupgrade; layout `STOCK`/`OPENWRT_STOCK_LAYOUT`; validated UBI preloader **and** a valid 128 KiB BL2 candidate | Reformats NAND to the canonical UBI layout. BL2 is committed last. |
| **Reset OpenWrt settings** | `POST /api/reset-openwrt-settings` | `RESET-OPENWRT-SETTINGS` | An OpenWrt layout; no operation active | Erases and recreates only `rootfs_data`. |
| **Check initramfs** | `POST /api/initramfs-begin` + `…/initramfs-chunk` | — | — | Stages and validates a standalone FIT. Read-only. |
| **Boot once** | `POST /api/expert/boot-once` | — | A validated bootable FIT | Boots the staged FIT from RAM. Writes nothing; `automatic_sysupgrade: false`. |
| **Validate UrsusBoot FIP** | `POST /api/ursus-fip-begin` + `…/ursus-fip-chunk` | — | — | Stages and validates a FIP. Read-only. |
| **Update UrsusBoot** | `POST /api/update-ursusboot` | `UPDATE-URSUSBOOT` | Fully received, validated FIP; no migration or FIP update active | Writes the bootloader FIP with readback verification. |
| **Reboot into OpenWrt** | `POST /api/reboot` | `REBOOT` | **A flash operation must have completed** | Reboots. Refused with 409 at any other time. |
| **Run** (console tab) | `POST /api/console` | `X-Ursus-Command` | — | Runs the command on the real U-Boot command line and returns the captured output. No allowlist. |

### Preparation and flashing pipeline

```text
pick file
  -> POST /api/<kind>-begin      declare size, generation, filename
  -> POST /api/<kind>-chunk ...  stream into the RAM staging window
  -> classify + validate         container, FIT, hashes, fwtool metadata,
                                 supported_devices, layout applicability
  -> status/log show a class     OK or a specific refusal reason
  -> operator confirms           explicit button + confirmation header
  -> operation armed             endpoint answers, then the main loop works
  -> write + readback verify     progress, stage and transaction state
  -> manual reboot               only after a completed operation
```

Recognized image classes: OpenWrt non-UBI sysupgrade (tar), OpenWrt UBI sysupgrade (FIT with fwtool metadata), standalone FIT (Expert channel only), factory kernel and factory rootfs (recognized, never accepted by the main channel).

Refusals are typed rather than generic — `OK`, `UPLOAD_INCOMPLETE`, `BAD_CONTAINER`, `BAD_FIT`, `HASH_MISMATCH`, `METADATA_MISSING`, `DEVICE_MISMATCH`, `UNSUPPORTED_IMAGE_CLASS`, `IMAGE_TOO_LARGE`, `LAYOUT_UNSUPPORTED`, `OPERATION_LOCKED` — so the UI and any host orchestrator can explain exactly why an image was rejected.

### HTTP API

```

Upload headers: `X-Ursus-Total`, `X-Ursus-Generation` and `X-Ursus-Filename` on `begin`; `X-Ursus-Offset`, `X-Ursus-Total` and `X-Ursus-Generation` on each `chunk`. A generation mismatch invalidates the session rather than silently mixing two uploads.

## UrsusFlasher: the recommended host orchestrator

[UrsusFlasher](https://github.com/Medvedolog/airoha-router-ursusflasher) is the companion **Windows and Linux installer/orchestrator/backup tool**. UrsusBoot is deliberately usable on its own, but UrsusFlasher provides the convenient operator layer around it:

- detects known Airoha/Nokia models and current boot/storage state;
- performs backups and validates them;
- installs or updates UrsusBoot from Nokia stock Linux, OpenWrt or UrsusBoot Recovery;
- accepts a **freshly built local UrsusBoot FIP** and chooses the convenient supported path — WebFailsafe, stock-root flashing or UART/Brick Mode — instead of making the operator reproduce the low-level write sequence by hand;
- performs readback verification and recovery workflows;
- handles Airoha BootROM/XMODEM/UART recovery for bricked devices;
- can be used as a transport/orchestrator for a **custom locally built UrsusBoot**, including Airoha hardware not yet represented by a first-class UrsusFlasher board profile, through the explicit Airoha UART/Brick-mode recovery path.

In other words, **UrsusBoot is the bootloader/recovery framework; UrsusFlasher is the operator-friendly installer, backup and recovery workstation around it.**

## Baseline

The initial public standalone baseline is the TEST61 lineage used by the Nokia XG-040G-MD work, with subsequent board modularization for XG-040G-MF / AN7583 and other Airoha targets. Historical TEST57-TEST60 iteration scripts are intentionally not part of the public build surface; TEST61 is treated as the clean baseline.

## Porting model

Porting should be board-policy driven rather than fork driven:

```text
UrsusBoot core
  +-- common WebFailsafe / image / UBI logic
  +-- Airoha SoC support
  +-- board policy
  |     +-- NAND geometry
  |     +-- boot/FIP layout
  |     +-- Ethernet/reset quirks
  |     +-- identity locations
  |     +-- supported image classes
  +-- storage policy
```

See `docs/PORTING.md`.

## Credits and lineage

UrsusBoot exists because a substantial amount of bootloader and OpenWrt work came before it. Particular thanks and respect go to:

- **Daniel Golle (dangowrt)** — for the OpenWrt U-Boot/UBI installation model, recovery-oriented bootloader work and the broader idea that the bootloader can understand OpenWrt rather than merely chainload it: https://github.com/dangowrt
- **hanwckf** — for the MediaTek `bl-mt798x` work, failsafe Web UI, multi-layout and direct firmware installation ideas that became a reference point for the wider router community: https://github.com/hanwckf/bl-mt798x
- **Yuzhii0718** — for continuing and extending that ecosystem, including modern WebFailsafe, DHCP/recovery and Airoha/MediaTek bootloader work used as a practical reference: https://github.com/Yuzhii0718
- **OpenWrt developers** — for the platform, image formats, U-Boot integration and the SDK/toolchain this project builds against: https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt
- **U-Boot and Trusted Firmware-A developers** — for the upstream boot stack on which all of this ultimately rests.

UrsusBoot is not presented as an isolated invention. It is a compact Airoha-focused continuation of ideas developed across that community, with its own board-policy, recovery, validation and transactional safety work layered on top.

## Safety

A successful software build or CI run is **not** hardware validation. New board ports must be treated as unproven until tested on real hardware with a documented recovery path.
