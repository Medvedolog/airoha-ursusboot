# Hardware test: recovery MAC stability

Validates the MAC identity work on a real unit. CI PASS does not cover any of this: the `ri` read, the environment write path and the Ethernet controller only exist on hardware.

Applies to `UrsusBoot 0.1.0-alpha5-UBIUX1-TEST61` and later. Read `README.md` → *Recovery MAC identity* first; it explains why some log lines are ambiguous on their own.

## Setup

- USB-UART **3.3 V** on TX / RX / GND, **115200 8N1**, no flow control, capture the whole session to a file.
- PC on **LAN2 or LAN3**. Not LAN1 (separate EN8811H PHY), not LAN4 (becomes WAN under OpenWrt).
- **Full power removal** between iterations. A warm `reset` does not re-run the probe path the same way and will not exercise what this test is for.
- Record the unit's sticker MAC before starting.

## What to capture on every boot

```text
# UART, at the UrsusBoot prompt
printenv ethaddr

# PC (Linux)
ip neigh flush dev <iface> 192.168.1.1
ping -c2 192.168.1.1
ip neigh show 192.168.1.1
```

macOS/Windows equivalents: `arp -d 192.168.1.1` then `ping -c2` / `ping -n 2`, then `arp -n 192.168.1.1` / `arp -a 192.168.1.1`.

## Reading the UART log

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `URSUS_MAC_SOURCE=RI ethaddr=…` | **The success marker.** MAC came from the `ri` volume. |
| `Warning: … using random MAC address - <mac>` | The environment held no MAC at probe time. Expected on a fresh unit and on the first boot after `reset_factory`. **Not** a failure by itself — but `URSUS_MAC_SOURCE=RI` must follow it. |
| `WARN: URSUS_MAC_RI_READ_FAIL fallback=…` | The `ri` volume could not be read. Always a finding. |
| `WARN: URSUS_MAC_INVALID_RI fallback=…` | `ri` was read but held `00:00:…` or `ff:ff:…`. Always a finding. |

A generated address is always locally administered: the first octet ends in `2`, `6`, `a` or `e` (`02:`, `1e:`, `7a:` …). A factory Nokia address never does. This tells a random MAC from a real one at a glance.

## A — cold boot stability

Three full power cycles. On each, capture the block above.

PASS requires all of:

- `URSUS_MAC_SOURCE=RI ethaddr=…` present on every boot;
- no `WARN:` lines from `ethaddr_factory`;
- `printenv ethaddr` identical across all three boots, and equal to the sticker MAC;
- the ARP MAC seen by the PC equals `ethaddr`;
- no `Warning: … using random MAC address` after the first boot.

| Boot | `ethaddr` | `URSUS_MAC_SOURCE` | random-MAC warning | ARP MAC on PC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |

## B — survives a FIP write and environment reset

This is the case the fix exists for: `boot_tftp_write_fip` ends in `reset_factory`, which wipes both `ubootenv` volumes.

1. Note `ethaddr` from test A.
2. Update the bootloader — the **Update UrsusBoot** tab in WebFailsafe, or the `boot_tftp_write_fip` path.
3. Two full power cycles, capturing the same block each time.

PASS requires all of:

- `ethaddr` after the update equals the value from test A;
- `URSUS_MAC_SOURCE=RI` on both boots;
- no `WARN:` lines;
- a single `Warning: … using random MAC address` on the first post-reset boot is acceptable **only** if `URSUS_MAC_SOURCE=RI` follows it and `ethaddr` still matches test A.

| Boot | `ethaddr` | matches A? | `URSUS_MAC_SOURCE` | `WARN:` lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| post-reset 1 | | | | |
| post-reset 2 | | | | |

## C — environment and controller agree

Catches the ordering hazard: the Ethernet probe runs before `preboot`, so on a boot that started with an empty environment the controller may have been programmed with a different MAC than the one `ethaddr_factory` later wrote into the environment.

1. Boot and open `http://192.168.1.1/`.
2. Reboot from the web UI.
3. When it comes back, open the page again **without** flushing ARP on the PC.

PASS: the page loads without any manual ARP intervention, and `ip neigh show 192.168.1.1` reports the same MAC as `printenv ethaddr`.

FAIL here means the environment and the controller's MAC filter disagree — capture the full UART log of that boot and the PC's ARP table before changing anything.

## Result

The test is HW PASS only if A, B and C all pass. Any `WARN:` line, any MAC change across boots, or any ARP mismatch is a FAIL — record the full UART log rather than retrying, since the interesting state is the one that produced it.
